This is both a backup of my current personal projects and a place to share the code for those kind and knowledgable enough to help with issues.<br>

Requirements Doc:<br>
I enjoy playing <b><em>"Empires & Puzzles"</b> (EnP)</em> on my phone, but the game has run into roadblocks because of design flaws.
Instead of just complaining about the game (not that <b>"Small Giant"</b> would even listen), I'm making my own game to fix those flaws, add an exciting new element of gameplay, and add in my own design flaws.

EnP has two distinct aspects: 
1) Stronghold resources like food and iron as well as hero upgrades.
2) Combat using Match3 gameplay as a fighting mechanic.

Lots of games have since come out to copy EnP's Match3 fighting mechanic, so that wouldn't be new. Further, it's the best aspect of the game as currently designed. It's simple, and it works.

The problem and the design flaw is in Stronghold management and hero upgrades.
1) Every building requires a set amount of food / iron to upgrade to the next level building. Once that low bar is achieved, the building can be upgraded which takes x time to wait. Once the building is maxed out, the building sits there "wasting space".
2) You have a limited amount of food / iron that you can produce and keep in storage. As the game has grown and the user base has matured, there's not that much need for food or iron, and the requirements for it are both arbitrary and unrealistic. Since everyone has the same maximum storage of both food and iron, there's only so much they can require.
3) Once everything is upgraded to their max level, there's little attention to be paid to the Stronghold area any longer. It exists, but that aspect of the game fades into the background other than the utility of the certain buildings like farms, training camps, and crafting.
4) The heros are upgraded by accepting any other hero to upgrade itself. (My 5 yr old once upgraded a 2-star hero with a 5-star hero because he didn't understand that the 5-star is better than the 2-star.) While it takes a while, each level has a set number of heros needed to upgrade to its final ascension and level. To combat rampant "mass upgrades" where you pour 1,000+ heroes at a time into 1 hero to go from brand new to maxed out, they introduced "rare" ascension material which hampers your ability to upgrade the hero until a specific item is found "by chance" or when it comes around in a special challenge once a year.
5) Various portal summons allow for new characters to be collected from the various lands and collections within the game, but the results often are the same characters you already have or a character that isn't even from the collection advertised.

To address these flaws, here are my proposed solutions:

Flaw 1) Building Upgrades and Uses <br>
  1) Upgrade Solution - I will turn the entire Stronghold aspect of the game into a Match-style game. So rather than just depending on food and iron to upgrade a building, you would also need to collect the requisite building parts which would then merge together to make the building. To upgrade the building, you'd have to build 2 buildings of the same level which can then merge into that next level building. Farm_1 + Farm_1 = Farm_2.
  2) Use Solution - These buildings produce the villagers for the Stronghold in that building's area of focus (butcher, garden, blacksmith, woodland, crafting). From these base villagers, a hero will emerge from their daily tasks to have exceptional skill in one of 5 different roles (mage, archer, paladin, barbarian, healer) from 5 different energy sources (sun, moon, fire, water, nature). Each building produces a resource toward the needs of the whole. Training camps hold inactive heroes who are waiting to merge to the next level.

Flaw 2) Arbitrary and limited need for food and resources <br>
  1) Food Solution - Every hero consumes a set amount of food / day based on his role, energy source, strength, and skill level. Thus the food would be in constant need and managing it and other resources would be important. A 10-star character could be a white elephant gift to a player too early in the game.
  2) Resource Solution - Resources produced go into the potions, weapons, and upgrades for all the heroes as well as their recovery after battle. Instead of bouncing from battle to battle as though nothing happened, each hero would need time and resources to recover depending on their level of damage in the battle. A wounded character would be able to be healed and get into the battle faster than an eliminated player which would have a mandatory "hospital" time.

Flaw 3) Stronghold use
  1) Use Solution - The Stronghold is the staging area for all active and recovering heroes. As the Stronghold upgrades, the number of teams that your heroes can be organized into also upgrades.

Flaws 4) Hero Upgrades
  1) Hero Strengthening Solution - Each hero in their role has 10 levels of skill which grow as the hero is used. This is a major difference fom EnP. Each hero starts at "Very Slow" in mana generation and skill level 0. Every time the hero uses their "Special Skill", they count toward their next skill level which both increases their mana generation speed and increases the number of skills they can use in combat.
  2) Hero Acquisition Solution - Heroes upgrade to the next strength level (star) when merged with another hero of the same kind. Instead of just having heroes ranging from 1-5 stars which is dependent upon "the algorithm" to determine who is lucky enough to get which stronger character vs a lesser character, there would be heroes of 1-10 stars along each role in both common and rare merge trees for each collection. Strength level (aka stars) are associated with the number of skills the hero can bring into combat. Which skills can be actually be brought vary based on their skill level. A 1-star & 2-star character can bring 1 skill into combat. A 3-star & 4-star character can bring 2 skills into combat. ... A 10-star character can bring 5 skills into combat. Once the hero is used in active combat and begins to upgrade their skill, they are ineligible for merger with another hero to make the next level of strength.
  3) Hero Skills Solution - Instead of each hero having a set set of skills from the time of acquisition that does not vary from weakest to strongest other than some fractional percentage, skills known to the Stronghold can be taught to any and all heroes. Once entering the character into active combat, they can be taught skills commensurate with their role up to the number of skills they can bring into combat. As each character levels up in skill, they can add a new skill to their arsenal up to the maximum of their strength (star) level.

Flaw 6) Portals and Other Collection Acquisition
  1) Portal Solution - When the player goes to other lands via a portal, they combat new collections of heroes. Heroes of this new collection can be captured from those lands and fight of your team, and local heroes can be trained in their skills.
  2) Other Collection Acquisition Solution - Each new portal and successful battle in that land increases the opportunities to build a building of that region in your village and grow your army by that strength. This also encourages more combat in those foreign lands to increase your supply of foreign heroes and upgrade your foreign building.

Thus from the ashes of "Empires and Puzzles" arises: <b>"Match and Merge Empire"</b>!
